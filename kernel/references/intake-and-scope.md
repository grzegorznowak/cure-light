# intake-and-scope.md — Phase 0: pull the subject, build the contract

Phase 0 runs once per **review state**. Its output is the **run manifest** — the single source of truth for every subsequent vector and the closure loop.

## The subject rule

cure-light reviews the tree it **pulls**, not the remote tip. Whatever SHA the pulled tree has at pull time is the version under review (reviewing the latest is desired, not a risk). The tree is stable for the whole state — nothing mutates it mid-run; a deliberate re-pull at an operator gate starts a **new review state** and updates the tree in place to the new head at that boundary (or pulls fresh when the tree is gone/broken, §0.1). A **contract-only repair** — the PR body/issue changed while no new code work was pulled — also opens a new review state with a recaptured contract snapshot; the tree itself is not re-pulled. An in-diff designated-source repair normally moves the subject OID even when executable code bytes are unchanged and is re-pulled as a new state on the new `base..subject` pair (both: closure-verification.md). Evidence is anchored to the subject; a state's findings never mix trees.

## 0.1 Pull the subject (preflight, ground truth)

**Subject-first.** Until the subject is pulled, nothing in the target repo's local checkouts is read or used for orientation — per review state (a deliberate re-pull starts a new state under the same rule). Pre-pull access is remote-only (`gh repo view` / `gh pr view` / `gh pr diff --name-only`) plus presence probes (chhound-driver.md §Presence); the only pre-pull local git command is the cure-light source provenance capture (§Output below). The pulled subject is the first tree cure-light reads for context or evidence.

At Phase 0:

- [ ] `gh auth status` — logged in, `repo` scope.
- [ ] `gh repo view <owner>/<repo>` reachable.
- [ ] `gh pr view <pr> --json headRefOid,baseRefOid,state,title` — PR exists and is OPEN; capture `baseRefOid` + the remote `headRefOid` as **informational context** (what gh reports now; NOT the subject).
- [ ] Pull the subject tree:
      - **re-pull, tree exists** (a new review state for a PR already pulled at `subject_path`) → update it **in place**: fetch the new head into the tree's repo and check it out detached (`git -C <subject_path> fetch …` + `git -C <subject_path> checkout --detach <new head>`). The rail sandbox needs no rail action: its live daemon re-indexes the sandbox automatically and the MCP bridge stays connected. A tree that is gone/broken (or a mechanism change) → pull fresh below.
      - **pi-chhound rail live** (chhound-driver.md §Presence) and no subject tree for this PR yet → create/connect the PR sandbox per [chhound-driver.md](chhound-driver.md) §Phase 0; the sandbox's worktree checkout is the subject.
      - **else** → plain detached worktree at the PR's current head, sourced as:
            - developer has an existing local clone of the target repo → source from that clone (fetch, then `git worktree add --detach <scratch>/tree <current headRefOid>`). Plumbing only — the clone is the git object source; its working tree is never read as context or evidence.
            - no local clone → clone the target repo into the review scratch dir (`git clone <target-url> <scratch>/tree`), fetch, then `git -C <scratch>/tree checkout --detach <current headRefOid>` — the clone is the subject.
      - `<scratch>` = the review scratch dir (e.g. `/tmp/cure-<owner>-<pr>/`); a fresh plain subject lands at `<scratch>/tree`, an in-place re-pull keeps the existing `subject_path`.
      - If the tree cannot be pulled at all, STOP (no evidence base).
- [ ] **Capture the subject**: `git -C <subject-path> rev-parse HEAD` → manifest `subject_oid`; the tree dir → `subject_path`. If `subject_oid` ≠ the gh-reported `headRefOid`, record both in the manifest — the pulled tree is the subject regardless (informational divergence, not an error). On an in-place re-pull the same `subject_path` gets the new `subject_oid`; the previous state's content stays reachable at its own OID (`git show <old_subject_oid>:<path>`).
- [ ] Complete the deferred requirements rows on the pulled tree (requirements-check.md rows 5/8/9) — the requirements check is complete only after this.
- [ ] (pi) `notebook_index` responds.
- [ ] (pi, optional) chhound index health (`{ch_prefix}_daemon_status`); fallback = bash/rg/grep. A broken index never blocks.

If any hard requirement fails: state the fallback (git/rg instead of chhound; plain worktree instead of sandbox) or STOP before fleet cost; a missing or degenerate required group pauses that stage instead — never a substitute.

## 0.2 Capture sources and draft claims

The contract lives in the **run store**: when the runtime's requirements check
confirms the notebook, Phase 0 writes it to the notebook page
`contract-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` (one per review state, named like the frame page of
that state); otherwise create `CONTRACT.md` in a scratch review dir (e.g.
`/tmp/cure-<owner>-<pr>/`). The run manifest records `contract_ref` — the page
name, or the disk path in fallback runs.

The contract holds:
1. PR **description** — the claims the implementer makes (feature list, validation counts, behavior promises).
2. Linked **issues/tickets** — full text: bullets, tech context, **locked decisions** (verbatim operator decisions are the durable contract).
3. **Host tech context** worth grounding (existing APIs the PR builds on; caveats the issue itself records).
4. The **changed-file list**. (Per-child diff slices are derived at spawn time from the subject tree — `git diff base_oid..subject_oid -- <paths>` split per surface — and are not part of the stored contract.)
5. The captured **subject OID / base OID** and a note that everything below analyzes exactly the pulled subject tree at `subject_path`.

Rule: the contract is the captured sources' own words — the verbatim PR description/title and linked issue/locked decisions as today, plus any in-diff spec/design material the PR **explicitly designates** as intended source — never the reviewer's paraphrase of intent and never an unpointed lookalike. Preserve verbatim blocks.

### Designated in-diff sources

A pointer in the PR body, linked issue, or a locked decision may **explicitly designate** an in-diff spec/design file or package (an openspec-style change package, a changed design/spec doc) as a claim source. The explicit pointer is the trust stamp: repository convention (openspec layout, ADR folder, delta conventions) may **interpret** a designated package — which of its files are normative vs advisory, which clauses are the operative delta vs the retained baseline, how its roles fit — but convention alone never confers authority, and an unpointed spec-looking file, changed README, incidental design paragraph or test snapshot is ordinary changed documentation: evidence or context, never a claim source. Record per source block: source class, the designating pointer, the selection/interpretation rule plus any base-side policy citation, path/section, normative vs advisory status, and explicit precedence (if any). The current source-format policy remains **Markdown** for designated claim sources; a designated non-Markdown source is captured as **context with a stated limitation** (never a claim source). Source-format expansion is an explicit checkpoint, not a side effect of replacing the old parser. A pointed resource that cannot be captured and pinned is likewise **context with a stated limitation**, never adjudicated as if read. When required designation or orientation is missing, record a `repair_required` record with `required: true` (the P0.2 `source_consistency` outcome stays clean) and record the affected changed units for V1 attribution against the captured contract pending repair; Phase 0 never finalizes UNCLAIMED. Never a reviewer-invented claim.

### P0.1 Immutable source capture

Capture the authorized sources verbatim, with exact-byte sha256 refs and version identity. Record `subject_oid` / `base_oid`, actual repo blob OIDs for selected in-diff sources (base blobs where delta interpretation needs them), source roles/designating pointers/selection rules, and timestamped PR body/issue snapshots. Source content comes from `git show <subject_oid>:<path>`, never a live edited checkout or the remote tip. A changed source version mid-state quarantines stale results and opens a new state at the operator gate — no mixed-source findings. The verbatim contract and capture refs remain authoritative; a drafted claim statement is not a replacement source.

### P0.2 Claims pass (`#fast`)

Read all captured, designated sources before inspecting delivery. Produce `claims-draft/3`: `sources`, `claims`, `nonclaims`, `conflicts`, `notes`, and structured `missing_source_candidates`. Each claim carries a run-scoped `id`, `statement`, `source_ref`, verbatim `quote`, and `also_in` source refs. Claims are promises or acceptance requirements: include a stated "Fixes X"; separate background defects, evidence and advisory discussion into nonclaims/notes, and never classify the same clause as both claim and nonclaim.

The draft absorbs the bounded **within-source and cross-source consistency pass**: compare material purpose/scope/behavior declarations, not every phrasing difference. Preserve conflicting quotes, offsets/source hashes, affected draft IDs and materiality reasoning in the source-consistency records. A material unresolved contradiction without explicit/locked precedence records a `repair_required` record (`required: true`, with its consistency witnesses) and defaults to pause before V1. Only an explicit operator disposition in `repair_required.continuation` — a named, bounded `evidence-only-v1` or `limited-v1-only` mode with scope and operator ref — may proceed through that pause; it neither clears the defect nor authorizes ordinary downstream work. Non-material wording inconsistencies are recorded without pausing. Clarification or repaired sources open a new review state. V1 audits the draft against the captured sources and dispositions these records (accept, or dispute with a witness); it re-opens the bounded pass only on a missing/uncaptured designated source, a quote/source-ref fidelity failure, a disputed/unsupported record, or a material contradiction the audit itself surfaces (conformance-pass.md). The final `review_basis` is computed after V1, not here.

Missing-source candidates name the resource, affected draft IDs, the reference quote and why it matters. They do not grant source authority or silently expand the contract; capture or record the limitation at the operator gate. Missing designation/orientation records a `repair_required` record with `required: true` (the P0.2 `source_consistency` outcome stays clean). Draft IDs are run-scoped handles, never canonical semantic identities. Preserve worker drafts and attempts; V1 validates and freezes claims against the captured sources before adjudication. Cross-run label/count differences are diagnostic only until source and instruction provenance are reconciled.

**Optional claims diagnostic (`verify claims`).** The claims check is not a
required stage: the mechanical boundary is the single delegated `verify join`
run (P0.4), which re-runs this validator internally as a fatal prerequisite.
When a claims failure needs localization or a per-class receipt, the
coordinator may spawn a `fast` child to execute the pinned `verify claims --run
<run-root>` command under the same delegation contract and record the stdout
JSON verdict verbatim plus exit code/stderr
([child-pass-prompt-template.md](../../assets/child-pass-prompt-template.md)).
The child verifies the frame-recorded verifier path/sha256 first; the coordinator
consumes the verdict and never re-implements, overrides or reruns the checks
itself. This validates the recorded envelope slice and the draft's structure,
pins and references — never claim semantics. A missing/degenerate `fast` pauses;
a recorded diagnostic never gates acceptance.

## 0.3 Chunk units, propose links, check the sweep

```text
P0.1 source capture (verbatim bytes + sha256 refs)
  → P0.2 claims pass (#fast; claims-draft/3 + source-consistency)
  → P0.3 shipped chunker (units manifest + whole-unit payloads)
  → P0.4 join pass (#fast; compact per-box join JSONL attempt — row shape P0.4)
    → delegated `verify join` (#fast child; single mechanical boundary) after the merged candidate is prepared
  → P0.5 coordinator semantic gate (consumes the fast-child pinned mechanical verdict; counts, types, witnesses, budgets, complete sweep)
  → join-draft/1 + candidate_unclaimed[]
  → capacity-bounded V1 split → operator Phase-0 gate
```

The `verify join` boundary re-runs the claims and units validators internally as
fatal prerequisites. `verify claims` and `verify units` remain available as
optional diagnostics — repair-loop localization and per-class receipts — and
their absence never gates acceptance.

### P0.3 Shipped chunker

Run the engine's [chunker](chunker.md), `kernel/tools/chunker.mjs`, over the state's two-dot `base_oid..subject_oid` diff. The compiled frame records its path, exact-byte sha256 and recipe; its identity rides `cure_light_source_head_oid`. The tool is shipped by cure-light, not supplied by the subject tree. It uses fixed windows at logical boundaries: target 4 KiB, ceiling 6 KiB; prefer file-end → hunk-end → block-end → line-end, never mid-line. The manifest and unit payloads are the inventory for the join and V1 accounting. Context and repeated hunk ranges are not unique changed-line counts; see the chunker contract and its explicit limitations. A missing or unrepresentable changed surface cannot quietly disappear into a completeness claim.

The units-manifest identity and payload path bases, the join-side field contracts and the repair map are documented in [artifact-contracts.md](artifact-contracts.md).

**Optional units diagnostic (`verify units`).** The units check is likewise not
a required stage: the single `verify join` boundary validates the same units
slice internally as a fatal prerequisite. After the chunker run, a units
failure may be localized by spawning a `fast` child to execute the pinned
`verify units --run <run-root>` command under the same delegation contract. It
validates the manifest identity, the recorded chunker recipe/pins and the
payload bytes (pins, byte lengths, counts, bounds and diff framing) against the
recorded evidence slice; it never executes the chunker or git and never
re-derives the unit inventory. A recorded diagnostic never gates acceptance.

### P0.4 Join pass (`#fast`)

Pack boxes by **input length only**: instructions + the full claim-ID/statement list + whole units in manifest order until the next unit no longer fits. Charge fixed input first; never trim the claims, split a unit across children, or add a unit-count cap. If fixed input or the next whole unit cannot fit an empty box, pause for a recorded budget decision. The input ceiling remains an operator-approved pilot value. There is **no output reservation in packing**; actual output is monitored separately.

Each child reads its complete claim list and assigned unit files and is the sole writer of one exact output path. Return compact JSONL: one row per assigned unit in order, including empty results; within `links`, one entry per `(unit_id, claim_id)`, no per-unit link cap. Link fields are `claim_id`, `closeness` (high/medium/low), `role_hint` (implements, tests, necessary-support, removes, changes — separate P0 tokens), and a nonempty, single-line verbatim witness from that unit. The pilot witness limit is 160 characters including the diff marker. Outer fields are `unit_id`, `links`, `unresolved` (null or a reason). Links mean "look here", never "this works". Appending is optional; JSONL on disk is mandatory. Verify the exact output path and return only a compact summary/path, not the rows in the coordinator's context.

**Delegated mechanical boundary (`verify join`).** After the merged candidate is
prepared but before it is accepted or published, the coordinator spawns a
`fast` child to execute the pinned `verify join --run <run-root>` command. This
single invocation is the mechanical acceptance boundary: it re-runs the claims
and units validators internally as fatal prerequisites (a failed prerequisite
surfaces as `join.prerequisites: prerequisite failed: <class>` with exit 1; an
unknown/wrong-kind prerequisite schema refuses with exit 2), then validates the
recorded assignments, rows/order/pairs, witnesses, budgets, recovery history,
merge, p05 sweep and candidate encoding against the exact input refs/hashes. A
stale successful merge, missing rows or a nonzero verdict never publishes: the
coordinator re-delegates repaired attempts or pauses.

### Pinned mechanical verifier (`kernel/tools/verify.mjs`)

The engine ships one zero-dependency Node 22+ verifier as a single byte-defined
artifact. The frame records its path, exact-byte sha256 and `tool_version`
(`1.0.0`) bound to `cure_light_source_head_oid`; the run envelope records the
same pin. Invocation:

`node <pinned-engine>/kernel/tools/verify.mjs <claims|units|join> --run <run-root>`

Exactly one `--run`; no extra positionals or unknown flags, and no
auto-repair, auto-fetch, `--force` or partial-pass mode. `--run` names the
artifact root (e.g. `run-artifacts/`), never the subject tree. Output is
exactly one JSON verdict on stdout plus newline:
`{ok,tool_version,schema,checks:[{name,ok,detail}],summary}`; stderr may carry
the short summary line. Exit codes: 0 pass / 1 validation failure / 2
usage-or-unknown-schema refusal. Nonzero is mechanically binding. Unknown
schema anywhere in the required graph refuses with 2 before ordinary failures;
otherwise any failed check is 1; `ok` is true only when every check passed.
Unhandled runtime errors are one failed diagnostic, never a partial pass.

**Envelope prep (`verify envelope`).** Before delegating the mechanical checks,
the coordinator generates the candidate `run-manifest.json` with the same
pinned tool:

`node <pinned-engine>/kernel/tools/verify.mjs envelope --run <run-root> --operator-ref <string> --chunker-sha256 <64-lowercase-hex> --input-ceiling-bytes <decimal nonneg int> [--output-ceiling-bytes <decimal nonneg int|none>] [--attempts <run-root-relative-ref>] [--approval <run-root-relative-ref>]`

This is prep/recording, not a verdict or a gate: the printed document is one
`run-verification/1` JSON object on stdout only, it never writes files
(redirect explicitly), and it never reads an existing run-manifest.json. The
frame binds the envelope sha256 before the delegated
`verify join` boundary command (and any optional diagnostic) run; regeneration
after that freeze is not verification — a changed envelope needs a fresh frame
pin and a fresh delegated verdict. A refusal exits 2 with summary
`REFUSE envelope: <reason>` and no document. Stage slices appear only when their artifacts exist (`claims_draft`;
`chunker`/`units_manifest`/`unit_payloads`;
`join_draft`/`join_boxes`/`join_attempts`); every pin is recomputed from
recorded bytes except the non-derivable policy inputs (`--operator-ref`,
`--chunker-sha256`, `--input-ceiling-bytes`, optional
`--output-ceiling-bytes`/`--attempts`/`--approval`). A `code-units-sim/3`
inventory with partial coverage may not prepare a V1 run without
`--approval <run-root-relative-ref>`: the generator refuses
`approval required for partial coverage` when the flag is absent, refuses
`approval artifact missing` when the referenced `operator-approval/1` artifact
does not exist, and otherwise records its exact bytes as `pilot.approval = {ref,
sha256}`; the delegated `verify join` re-binds those bytes to the recorded skips.
Without `--attempts` the generator
records first-attempt acceptance per current box — the tree cannot prove a
retry did not happen — so runs with retries or splits must supply the recorded
history; recovery semantics are validated by the delegated `verify join`, not
by the generator.

**Fail-closed envelope identity.** Every command also enforces the recorded
pin: `verifier.path` is exactly `kernel/tools/verify.mjs` (absent or non-string
fails shape; a different path fails `verifier.identity`); envelope `run` and
`review_state` are nonempty strings; `base_oid`, `subject_oid` and
`cure_light_source_head_oid` are 40-char lowercase hex; `pilot.operator_ref` is
a required nonempty string; `pilot.output_ceiling_bytes` is exactly `null`
(monitoring only) or a nonnegative integer; and every present primary pin entry
(`claims_draft`, `units_manifest`, `join_draft`) must carry a nonempty
`schema_version` string. Violations fail closed (exit 1) instead of silently
skipping a check.

**Fail-closed delegation.** The coordinator spawns a `fast` child to execute the
pinned command (child-pass-prompt-template.md); the child returns the verdict
verbatim. A missing/degenerate `fast` group pauses; the coordinator never
substitutes a run-authored script, never re-implements or reruns the checks in
its own context, and never proceeds on a stale verdict. A nonzero exit, a
missing or unparseable verdict, a truncated return, a verifier path/sha256
mismatch, or an ok/exit inconsistency fails the mechanical boundary. The tool
proves recorded artifact mechanics only — materiality, source
authority/precedence, `repair_required`, `review_basis`, attribution and
dispositions stay coordinator/V1 semantic work.

**Repair protocol (distinct `fast` child).** A failed check is repaired by a
distinct `fast` artifact-preparation/repair child spawned with the exact
verdict/error refs, the pinned docs
([artifact-contracts.md](artifact-contracts.md)) and the authorized artifact
paths. The repair child is never the verification child and never the
coordinator: it restores the recorded field to the recorded meaning, never
changes captured source meaning, witness bytes, policy or claims semantics
just to pass, retains the failed attempt and re-freezes only under the
existing rewrite rules. Ambiguity or an identity/refusal case pauses for the
operator; the coordinator never reads tool source and never reruns the
verifier itself — the boundary is re-delegated after repair.

**Check suppression.** Checks run in a fixed order and an earlier failure aborts
the pipeline; dependent later checks may therefore be absent from `checks[]`.
Absence means NOT EVALUATED and can never be read as a pass; the exit code stays
nonzero (1 or 2), and `ok` is true only when every emitted check passed.
Duplicate JSON object keys are resolved by the host JSON parser (last value
wins); the verifier performs no duplicate-key detection.

**Read boundary.** All data IO stays inside the resolved `--run` root (lexical
and realpath containment; reject symlink escape, traversal, URI refs, nonregular
files and duplicate/colliding refs). The verifier never reads the subject tree,
never executes git, network or subject code, and never writes run artifacts; it
reads its own bytes only for the self-hash identity check.

**Payload walk.** The payload walk does not traverse symlinked directories;
payload files must be regular files inside the run root (outside-root targets
refuse).

**Dispatch and envelope.** Validators are keyed by `schema_version` in the
single file: `claims-draft/3`, `code-units-sim/3`, `join-draft/1`; the envelope
`<run-root>/run-manifest.json` carries `run-verification/1`. A supported schema
belonging to another command is a wrong-kind refusal (2). The envelope is a
recorded-input projection — the coordinator records refs/pins while preparing
artifacts, never validation logic. It holds run/state/base/subject and
`cure_light_source_head_oid`, the verifier pin
`{path,sha256,tool_version}`, capture/claims/chunker/units/join pins, the pilot
policy `{operator_ref,input_ceiling_bytes,witness_max_chars:160,
retry_limit:1,resplit:'halves',max_resplit_depth:1,output_ceiling_bytes:null|int,
optional approval:{ref,sha256}}`,
`join_boxes` pins and the structured `join_attempts` history. Stage-dependent
entries are absent until produced; each command requires only its own evidence
slice and never requires future-stage refs.

**Schema and profile.** `claims-draft/3` uses the frozen S28 structural profile:
sources `{source_ref,locator,path,role,sha256,byte_length[,blob_subject]}`;
claims `{id,statement,source_ref,quote,also_in}`; nonclaims
`{id,statement,source_ref,quote,reason}`; conflicts
`{id,kind,materiality,quotes[{source_ref,quote,offset_bytes}],affected_claim_ids,precedence,witness,reasoning}`;
notes `{note}`; candidates
`{resource,affected_claim_ids,reference_quote,why_it_matters}`. No magic
fallback accepts a second shape. `candidate_unclaimed[]` is unique unit-ID
strings in manifest order, exhaustive against all zero-link decidable units;
populated `zero_units`/`zero_claims`/`unresolved` support arrays are unit-ID /
claim-ID strings. Witnesses are ≤160 Unicode code points, nonempty,
single-line, byte-substring of the exact unit payload starting at a line
boundary with a real diff marker (`+`, `-`, context space, `@@ `), or a
recognized metadata marker for `boundary_kind:'file'` units.

**NOT IMPLEMENTED.** The `ledger`, `findings` and `closure` validators are a
follow-up registry seam only — the first slice ships `claims`, `units` and
`join`, and there is no CLI placeholder that returns success for them. The
coordinator still materializes those semantic records.

### P0.5 Coordinator semantic gate

The mechanical checks shipped in `kernel/tools/verify.mjs` run in the delegated
`fast` child (child-pass-prompt-template.md); the **merge decision remains
coordinator behavior**. The coordinator consumes the fast-child pinned
mechanical verdict — never re-implementing, overriding or rerunning the checks
in its own context — and confirms it covers the expected path and exact
assigned-unit sweep; strict row types and required fields; one row per unit and
one link per unit/claim pair; valid IDs and enums; witness length, single-line
form and containment in that unit's exact bytes; and recorded input/output
budgets. Check zero-link units, zero-link claims and unresolved/hard cases
separately. A missing/truncated/invalid row is never an empty match. Retain
attempts, retry/re-split within the approved policy, and disclose unresolved
residue when recovery is exhausted — never reuse a stale successful merge. The
input ceiling stays an operator-approved pilot value. The verifier enforces the
recorded envelope constants (one retry, `resplit:'halves'`, depth ≤ 1) and the
exact halves geometry: left = floor(n/2) units, right = the remainder (right
larger for odd n), both nonempty, manifest order preserved, no unit split. A
passing verdict proves artifact mechanics only — never claim correctness,
complete source interpretation or review readiness.

Merge validated records into `join-draft/1`; zero-link, decidable units are only `candidate_unclaimed[]`. P0.5 validates mechanics and sweep completeness, not claim correctness, complete source interpretation or final negative attribution. V1 validates/freezes claims, judges delivery and alone finalizes UNCLAIMED. Suite-level claims without a single-unit witness and the real missing-source/designation cases remain explicit hard cases, never guessed links or invented claims.

### Capacity-bounded vector split compile

Each vector's fleet splits the contract surface, capacity-bounded within the approved budget. Example split for a model-group/spawn PR:

- conformance: contract surfaces (derivation core · persistence/schema guard · spawn/router gate · main-session+TUI · tests), each compiled into bounded claim/range shards — one verdict owner per claim, one accounting owner per unit — plus residual attribution shards for changed units with no candidate claim — candidate_unclaimed entries are leads for V1, never final negatives (work packaging only, never invented contracts)
- implementation: sealed concepts the review already established (never open-ended), + **`read` lens and the `blast` judgment rows** (the once-per-state sweep runs in the deterministic preflight)
- debt: pluggability · boundary ownership · versioning/migrations · projections · perf/operability, + **`dead`/`read`/`name`/`quality` lens ownership**

Slice granularity is chosen so each child reads a bounded file set + the relevant contract slice + its assigned artifact refs and V1 coverage shard pages, and returns under a defined evidence budget.

The compiled split is the vector's **`fleet_plan`** — a recorded decision, not an improvisation: shard id, group, owned facets (or claims/units for V1), and a per-facet **depth budget** (the minimum checking each owned facet/lens receives, distinct from its output budget). V1's plan is compiled here and recorded on the frame page (`fleet_plan`, libs/pi-driver/references/notebook-plan-contract.md) before the Phase-0 gate; V2's plan is compiled at the V1 gate ([implementation-pass.md](implementation-pass.md)) and V3's at the V2 gate ([debt-pass.md](debt-pass.md)), each recorded before that vector's children spawn. A vector without a recorded plan does not spawn. One child owns at most two sealed concepts (V2) or two debt axes (V3) unless the plan records why a larger load is safe — V1 keeps the claim/unit ownership rules below — and no facet may be folded into another child silently. Depth budgets are minimums: V1 names a verdict per assigned claim, an accounting state per assigned unit and the checks it exercises; V2 names its `read` checks per owned concept and four `blast` rows; V3 names at least two distinct searches and one recorded evidence artifact per owned axis/lens. Any mid-run amendment to a plan is recorded at the next gate with a reason.

The split compile asserts **Vector 1 coverage** — a verdict owner for every captured claim, an accounting owner for every eligible (non-excluded) changed unit — distinct from the lens assertion below. The lens matrix (hygiene-lens.md) is compiled here and validated: every active lens must map to ≥1 owner. Deterministic preflight (strict tsc / lint) is the `type` sweep and `dead` accelerant; it also produces the state's once-per-state `symbol_sweep` symbol map (recipe: chhound-driver.md, Symbol sweep) — consumed by the V2 splits for the `sweep` row, seeded into V3 debt and the yagni pass, and rendered as the comment's `Symbol impact`.

## 0.4 Operator gates

- **Plan gate (pre-pull).** Before Phase 0 mutates anything external, surface the compiled plan for confirmation: subject mechanism (chhound sandbox | plain worktree) and planned location, vectors, splits, groups, the fleet policy (per-vector groups, the at-most-two-facets-per-child cap with recorded exceptions, and the depth-budget units from §0.3b), gates, output policy. The planned research mode (chhound-rail when the sandbox rail is planned, else direct-tree — pipeline-model.md) is part of the plan. The frame carries **no tree fields yet** — `subject_path` / `subject_oid` cannot exist before the pull (subject-first, §0.1).
- **Phase 0 gate (post-pull).** One gate with three sub-checklists:
      - **Artifact validity** — the written verbatim `contract-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` page (or the prescribed `CONTRACT.md` disk fallback) exists at `contract_ref`, is readable and matches it; the source capture identities; the shipped chunker path/sha256/recipe bound to `cure_light_source_head_oid`; the state's claims-draft, units-manifest and join-draft refs/hashes, and the current delegated `verify join` verdict (ref, sha256, exit code) pinned to those exact input refs/hashes with the frame-recorded verifier pin; a stale, missing or nonzero join verdict stops the mechanical boundary. Optional `verify claims`/`verify units` diagnostic verdicts may be recorded in the same shape when run, and never gate. The single join verdict re-runs the claims and units validators internally as fatal prerequisites, so it proves recorded artifact mechanics for all three artifact classes — not claim semantics or review readiness. Check P0.5 evidence against expected assignments and disclose retry/resplit failures, incomplete sources and hard cases. Missing or stale artifacts never authorize complete coverage; pause or record the operator-approved limited scope. No installed claim plugin, canonical claim-ID permission or census gate is required. The gate does not finalize UNCLAIMED or establish `review_basis: ready`; those remain V1 responsibilities.
      - **Plan reality** — surface the manifest with the recorded reality: actual `subject_path` / `subject_oid`, `base_oid`, changed-file list from the pulled tree, unit/file/line-split counts, P0.5 expected/received rows and link counts, zero-link claims, candidate_unclaimed units and unresolved hard cases and the exclusion policy (evidence-linked classes — a path suffix alone is never sufficient), the V1 `fleet_plan` (shard → group → owned claims/units → depth budget) for approval or recorded amendment, coverage-page location and budgets it approves, deferred requirements-row outcomes, fallback notes — a chhound-rail fallback (rail confirmed but sandbox pull/connect failed) also flips `research.mode` to `direct-tree` and `ch_prefix` to `none` (pipeline-model.md), so children render Variant B, never a rail variant whose tools are not connected.
      - **Repair + continuation** — the P0.2 `source_consistency` outcome (clean or recorded non-material inconsistency) and the independent `repair_required` record (`required`, `records`, `continuation`); missing designation/orientation is a clean-consistency + `required: true` case. A `required: true` record defaults the run to **pause before Vector 1**: the operator requests author clarification/repair, or records an explicit disposition in `repair_required.continuation` — a named, bounded `evidence-only-v1` or `limited-v1-only` mode with scope and operator ref (recorded scope/rationale/state) — that does not clear the defect or authorize ordinary downstream work. Thinness is judged across all explicitly designated, capturable sources — not PR-body length: a terse body with an accurate pointer to a complete designated package can pass; reviewer-invented claims are never an option. The repair-pause default applies to any `repair_required` defect (missing designation/orientation included), not just contradictions: the operator requests author repair, runs an explicitly limited V1-only review, or stops. Both pre-V1 continuations (the evidence-only run and the limited V1-only review) are named, bounded and recorded, and neither clears the defect nor authorizes ordinary downstream work. Contract-only repair is a new review state even when no code work is pulled (subject rule above; closure-verification.md). The run proceeds to Vector 1 only after this gate.

```

**Pilot checkpoints.** The operator-approved `input_ceiling_bytes` (recorded in the run envelope; a missing approved ceiling fails closed) and suite-level claim handling, possible tightening of `medium`, and the detailed V1 freeze/return contract still require operator review. The populated `claims-draft/3` conflict-record profile and the `candidate_unclaimed[]` element encoding are frozen (S28 structural profile; unique unit-ID strings in manifest order — see the pinned-verifier subsection); the output byte ceiling is monitoring-only unless declared, and bytes never prove a token ceiling. A referenced but uncaptured defining source requires an explicit capture-or-limitation decision.

The provenance field `cure_light_source_head_oid` is captured **once, at intake**, from the cure-light source checkout (`git -C <cure-light clone> rev-parse HEAD`). It is the "version at the time of reviewing": the single review comment composes its attribution footer from this manifest value alone, never re-derived per vector (see evidence-format.md, External routing).

Every **active** lens in the matrix must have ≥1 owning pass before Phase 0
proceeds — a lens without an owner is a frame error, not a "nothing found"
default; an inactive lens (matrix `off`, e.g. a skipped yagni pass) needs no
owner.
