# evidence-format.md — finding schema, severity, origin

Every finding in a cure-light run conforms to this shape. It is the interop contract between fleet children, the coordinator, the notebook, and gh artifacts.

## Finding schema

```yaml
id: <vector-letter><#>            # V1-V3 + seq, e.g. F2-03 or D3-01 (yagni: Y-01)
vector: conformance | implementation | debt | yagni
lens: type | dead | read | name | blast | test | security | yagni | quality | none   # optional; see hygiene-lens.md + blast-lens.md + quality-lens.md
lens-checked: [<lens>, ...]       # lenses proven exercised on this artifact
summary: one line
evidence:
  file: path:line            # primary anchor in the subject tree
  code: <verbatim or exact shape>
  side: subject | base | metadata    # optional; required when the anchor is not a surviving subject-tree line
  oid: <tree OID the anchor was read from>   # optional; old/base-side or metadata-event provenance
  range_or_event: <old-side range / metadata event ref at its OID>   # optional; deletion / rename / mode / binary anchors
severity: HIGH | MED | LOW
origin: PR-introduced | pre-existing   # Vector 2+ ; conformance is PR-only by definition
disposition: fix-in-PR | pre-existing-debt | deferred-decision | track-separately
             # fix-in-PR = in scope (introduced or enforced); pre-existing-debt = out-of-scope
             # follow-up (recommended or downstream); deferred-decision / track-separately record
             # an accepted deferral or an own ticket
conformance_kind: claim-gap | unclaimed-delivery   # optional; Vector-1 findings only (see below)
coverage_ref: <coverage page ref + canonical claim IDs / unit group/selector + canonical registry_hash + census_hash>   # optional; ties a V1 finding to ledger records projected from the producer's canonical artifacts
failure_mode: <concrete failure: divergence for claim-gap; undeclared delivered behavior for unclaimed-delivery>
status: open | verified-fixed | re-classified | test-only | doc-only | deferred-decision | closed-by-operator | re-opened
owner: <implementer | operator | subsystem>
subject_oid: <tree OID this row's evidence was read from>   # optional in schema; the coordinator fills it on every new/updated row
linked: <external follow-up URL | none>
```

`assets/finding-schema.json` is the machine form. `lens` and `lens-checked`
are optional (a conformance finding usually has `lens: none`); when they are
absent the row still counts toward the vector, but the **lens matrix** (see
pipeline-model.md) is what proves per-lens coverage of the run.

**Coverage is not a taxonomy.** Vector 1 keeps per-unit accounting in the
coverage ledger (notebook pages, below); only two narrow kinds become findings:
`conformance_kind: claim-gap` (the old GAP shape — missing backing,
contradiction, overstatement) and `conformance_kind: unclaimed-delivery` —
delivered behavior absent from the captured declared scope, evidenced by unit
IDs plus the attribution audit. An unclaimed-delivery finding is **in-scope and
blocking**: the owner declares/justifies the behavior in the PR description or
removes it (a declaration changes the contract and lands as a closed/new state,
closure-verification.md). It is never demoted to a follow-up; its narrow
failure-mode exception is documented under Writing findings.

**Contract adequacy is a gate disposition, not a finding kind.** Description
defects — a misleading/empty body, missing source designation or orientation, a
material unresolved source contradiction — are author-facing conformance items
with the existing kinds/severity and a concrete remedy (source-declaration vs
delivery-role separation: conformance-pass.md §Sources declare); a
`review_basis` value (`ready` / `limited-only` / `blocked` / `unknown`) and its
basis blockers are coordinator process records (frame/claims pages), never an
omnibus "bad contract" finding, a new severity class, or a new comment section.
A ready basis never erases a blocking finding, and an accepted finding
disposition never establishes readiness.

**Mechanical pins, not semantic proof.** Claim IDs, counts and `registry_hash`
come only from the pinned producer (`claim-registry` 0.3.0) and are consumed
only under the state's `gate-check` permission; the changed-unit denominator and
its IDs come from the pinned `census` artifact (`census_hash`). A finding or
coverage page that cites an ID absent from the canonical registry, or asserts
completeness without the gate permission, is invalid — re-seal and re-project,
never improvise or hand-add an ID. Mechanical passes prove byte identity,
ownership and internal consistency; they never prove that all authorized
sources were selected, that labels are semantically right, or that coverage is
complete (conformance-pass.md).

`subject_oid` is schema-optional for backward compatibility but **rule-required**
for every new or updated row: it records which review-state tree the row's
evidence was read from, so a findings page spanning several review states never
mixes trees silently. The coordinator fills it from the state's manifest.
Because a re-pull updates the tree in place, the working tree holds only the
latest subject: an older row's `file:line` is re-read at that row's `subject_oid`
(`git show <subject_oid>:<path>`), never from the current checkout.

A mechanical sweep that cannot run on the subject tree marks its lens
`inconclusive-mechanical` in the **lens trail** — checked by static sight, not
compiler output — never a silent skip and never a finding-status by itself.

## Severity semantics

- **HIGH** — data loss / security / wrong routing / a contract-mandated behavior is contradicted or unverifiable at the core and no backstop exists.
- **MED** — real user-visible defect or race, or a behavior claim missing the test that would catch its regression; backstopped so not catastrophic.
- **LOW** — brittle, fragile, or coverage-without-assurance; cosmetic; deferred by design.
- **Unclaimed-delivery findings (`conformance_kind`)**: LOW default; MED only for material undeclared behavior / API / operational commitment with an articulated review or compatibility consequence — never HIGH from the absence of a declaration alone; independent current harm is a Vector 2 finding.
- **Yagni rows (`yagni` lens)**: LOW default, MED ceiling — existence questions are advisory (non-blocking); current harm is V2's, future-change cost is V3's.
- **Quality rows (`quality` lens)**: LOW default, MED only when the quality problem's *own scale* is material — never HIGH, rated independently of product criticality (a spaghetti tree in a payments feature is not elevated because payments is critical); advisory (non-blocking), lens-trail only.
- **Blast rows (`blast` lens)**: LOW default, MED ceiling — never HIGH, suggestion-only; the concrete hazard instance is a Vector 2 finding at its own severity (blast-lens.md).

## Origin rule (Vector 2+)

Decide by **base diff**, never vibes:
`git show <base>:<path>` → is the mechanics present at base? If yes and the PR only touches it in passing → pre-existing. If the path (field/gate/logic/README-claim) is new → PR-introduced.

## Research traces are process metadata

Vector-2 and Vector-3 children attach a RESEARCH TRACE footer (implementation-pass.md / debt-pass.md). The trace records how leads were gathered; it is process metadata, not finding evidence:

- Index-derived `file:line` references and origin labels are invalid until verified in the subject tree / by base diff.
- A finding's evidence stands only on tree-verified anchors; a trace without verified anchors does not upgrade a finding.

## Writing findings

- Every finding needs a **concrete failure mode** — not a style opinion. The narrow exception: `unclaimed-delivery` states the undeclared delivered behavior and its unit evidence instead of an invented runtime failure; coverage states themselves are ledger records, not findings.
- Deletion / metadata findings state the anchor's `side`, `oid`, path and `range_or_event`, plus the checked subject absence (or the surviving subject anchor) — never a bare "file is gone".
- `NOT-A-BUG` results are listed too (checked and dismissed), cheap honesty that keeps the fleet honest.
- Hygiene hits follow the **lens trail** (hygiene-lens.md): detection mandatory, LOW by default, operator-suppressible per instance — they never pollute the bug table.
- `yagni` rows (yagni pass) follow the same lens trail with the same suppression/closure semantics — suggestion-only, never bug/debt tables.
- `quality` rows (V3 lens) follow the same lens trail — suggestion-only, rated by the problem's own scale, never bug/debt tables.
- `blast` rows (V2 lens) follow the same lens trail — suggestion-only, never bug/debt tables; the concrete data-hazard instance routes to the bug table as a Vector 2 finding (blast-lens.md).
- Evidence is read from the state's **subject tree** at its recorded `subject_oid` (intake-and-scope.md §0.1). Every row carries `subject_oid`; if a child read a different tree, its output is `inconclusive` — a checkout whose HEAD differs from the row's OID is a different tree.
- A completeness statement cites the canonical pins: the producer `registry_hash` and the `gate-check` permission for the claim universe, the `census_hash` for the changed-unit denominator. Mechanical pins never stand in for semantic coverage — "complete" means accounted/attributed under the state's pins, not that every claim was judged correct.

## Notebook layout

- `pipeline-frame-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` — frozen run options, base OID, planned subject mechanism; the manifest's tree fields (`subject_path` / `subject_oid`, changed-file list), contract-source pins/designation, the source-consistency outcome (provisional `repair_required` / evidence-only authorization) and the post-V1 `review_basis` record are recorded at their gates (notebook-plan-contract.md). Written at seal, completed at Phase 0 and the V1 gate.
- `symbol-map-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` — the preflight symbol map (chhound-driver.md, Symbol sweep): selected symbols, census heat table, capped outside locations, provenance/caps. One per review state; a bounded state cache kept while the state's consumers run (V2 sweep, V3 seed, yagni), discarded when the state closes.
- `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` — Vector 1 coverage summary/index: denominator and counts by state and side, completion flags, exclusion classes/policy, exact refs to the ledger shards. The paged ledger records themselves live in `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>-p<k>` pages (bounded, coordinator-owned, **in-notebook** — never scratch files); workers read only their assigned pages/slices. Kept through the state's closure/finalization window, retired after durable snapshots land.
- `claims-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` — the **projection of the canonical claim registry** produced by the pinned `claim-registry` 0.3.0 run (identical claim IDs, counts and `registry_hash`; reassembly/hash-equality checked; published only under the state's `gate-check` permission): canonical claim IDs, source spans + quote hashes, parent/group links, context/nonclaim labels, per-source class/designating pointer/selection rule/interpretation (normative vs advisory, precedence), labeling-mode provenance. The queryable complete claim directory for Vector 1 negative attribution (paged `-p<k>` when long). Source-consistency contradiction records (exact quotes/offsets/source hashes/affected claim IDs, materiality witness) live with it.
- `pr-<n>-review` — findings table (schema rows) + closure table. Appended per vector.
- `decisions` (durable, survives the PR) — deferred-decision and closed-by-operator records with author/time/rationale/scope, plus the leading subarea open questions.

The coordinator owns writes. Children return compact records; they never race the notebook.

## External routing

Finalization is **one aggregated review comment per run** — never per-finding comments, never separate issue drafts. The pipeline drafts it only when the intake field `draft_comment` is `true`; with `false`, the run is review-only: findings and suggested issues stay in the notebook, and a draft is prepared only on explicit request.

The single review comment contains:

```text
## Summary                     — owner/repo pr# @ head OID, vectors run, review
                                basis + any outstanding repair requirement,
                                approved/omitted scope; coverage accounting
                                totals/limits by state and side
## Findings                    — in scope of this PR (introduced or enforced by it;
                                origin may still be pre-existing): file:line evidence,
                                severity, origin — to be addressed
## Symbol impact               — the preflight symbol map, when the diff changes a
                                shared sentinel / identifier: top rows by outside-
                                occurrence count (census over the declared scope at
                                `<subject_oid>`), provenance, caps — mechanical
                                counts only, never triage labels, heuristic splits,
                                verdicts, or a claim that unread remainders were
                                cleared; never a lens-row judgment
## Potential follow-up issues  — out of this PR's scope, optional, never required:
                                · recommended — easy / best bang for the buck items,
                                  worth addressing while the area is open
                                · downstream — only low-impact + heavy implementation,
                                  or pre-existing issues this PR did not introduce
[attribution footer — see below]
```

**Scope routes the comment.** `origin` is base-diff evidence, not the routing key. **In scope** = the PR owns the issue: introduced by the PR, or pre-existing on a path the PR's own change now depends on, routes through, or claims to guarantee (a new gate, validation, dependency, standard, or contract claim). **Out of scope** = the PR neither introduces the issue nor depends on/claims that path — a passing touch does not make it enforced. In-scope items go to Findings, to be addressed — never a follow-up suggestion; only out-of-scope items may appear under follow-ups.
- **Coverage accounting renders in Summary; confirmed unclaimed delivery renders in Findings.** `EXPLAINED` / `EXCLUDED` / `UNRESOLVED` totals, exclusion classes and honest limits stay in the summary and the coverage pages; grouped `unclaimed-delivery` rows are in-scope, blocking, to be addressed — never follow-ups. No fourth comment section.

- **Never auto-post.** The single draft is operator-gated at the `before_post` pause — mandatory whenever `draft_comment` is enabled — and the operator may edit or veto it.
- **Lens-trail rows stay in the notebook** (hygiene / blast / quality / yagni) and are never included in the comment; the one exception is the mechanical `Symbol impact` table — outside-occurrence counts with census scope, provenance, and caps (chhound-driver.md, Symbol sweep), never a row's advisory judgment.
- **Issues are suggested, not drafted.** cure-light never composes `gh issue` bodies; a developer may open follow-up issues from the "Potential follow-up issues" section. A `linked` value may be added later, when a developer or operator has created the issue.
- **Attribution footer.** The single review comment ends with the cure-light attribution footer, composed **solely from run-manifest values**:

  ```text
  _Reviewed with [cure-light](https://github.com/grzegorznowak/cure-light) @ <cure_light_source_head_oid short form> — reviewed subject <subject_oid>_
  ```

  - `cure_light_source_head_oid` (intake-and-scope.md, §Output) is the cure-light source checkout's HEAD at intake — the "version at the time of reviewing", frozen once so it survives handoffs. Never re-derived per vector (no live `git rev-parse`, `gh` lookup, or CHANGELOG semver).
  - The footer appears only on the review comment — never on notebook pages.
  - If the source commit could not be established at intake, **omit the footer rather than fabricate one**.
  - A new review state (deliberate re-pull, closure loop) uses its own `subject_oid` in the footer.
