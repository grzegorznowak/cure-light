# notebook-plan-contract.md — where review state lives

The notebook is the shared memory between phases, children, and handoff contexts. The coordinator owns writes; children return compact records and never race pages.

## Page layout

| Page | Owner | Contents | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pipeline-frame-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` | coordinator (seal → Phase 0) | frozen run options + planned subject mechanism (chhound sandbox | plain worktree) — no tree fields at the pre-pull gate; `subject_path` / `subject_oid`, changed-file list, contract ref (page or path), research binding (mode chhound-rail | direct-tree, `ch_prefix`, exact tool names, excluded namespaces, fallback reason), contract-source pins/designation, the shipped chunker path/sha256/recipe at `cure_light_source_head_oid`, claims-draft / units-manifest / join-draft refs/hashes, Phase-0 input budget and P0.5 sweep/hard-case evidence, the P0.2 `source_consistency` outcome and the independent `repair_required` record (records + continuation) and the post-V1 `review_basis` record, and fallback notes recorded at their gates once the pull lands | one review state; a deliberate re-pull or a contract-only repair starts a NEW frame (linked by diff), never overwritten in place |
| `contract-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` | coordinator (Phase 0) | the verbatim contract (§0.2): PR description, linked issues + locked decisions, explicitly designated in-diff sources with designating pointer/role/interpretation, source pins (blob OIDs/hashes/version refs), changed-file list, subject/base OIDs; its existence, read and match to the manifest's `contract_ref` are verified at the Phase-0 gate | one review state, like the frame; a re-pull or a contract-only repair compiles the new state's contract |
| `claims-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` | coordinator (Phase 0 → V1) | source-bound claims-draft ref/hash and claims/nonclaims/conflicts/notes/missing-source candidates, source designation/interpretation and consistency witnesses; V1 validation/freeze evidence and the resulting complete queryable claim directory (paged `-p<k>` when needed). Draft IDs are run-scoped, not canonical plugin identities; preserve the original draft and trace changes | one review state; retained bytes and source/claim refs stay addressable through closure/finalization |
| `symbol-map-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` | coordinator (preflight, before V2) | the state's symbol map: selected symbols, census heat table, capped outside locations, provenance/caps (chhound-driver.md, Symbol sweep) | one review state; kept through the state's consumers (V2 sweep, V3 seed, yagni), discarded when the state closes |
| `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` (summary/index) | coordinator (Vector 1) | Vector 1 changed-unit accounting: denominator + counts by state and side, claims refs, per-shard assignment refs/digests, exclusion classes/policy, completion flags, exact refs to the `-p<k>` ledger shards — the authoritative store, never scratch files | one review state; kept through the state's closure/finalization window, retired after durable snapshots land in findings/decisions |
| `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>-p<k>` (bounded ledger shards) | coordinator (Vector 1) | structured per-unit records: unit/range, accounting state, attribution edges, evidence refs + units-manifest identity and chunker recipe; workers read only their assigned pages/slices | one review state; a re-pull writes a new `-s<n>` set, never overwrites; kept through the closure/finalization window, retired after durable snapshots land |
| `pr-<n>-review` | coordinator (append per vector) | findings table (schema rows, each carrying `subject_oid`) + closure table | one PR, all review states |
| `dis-<n>-review` (or the durable `decisions` page when follow-ups survive) | coordinator | deferred-decision + closed-by-operator records: author/time/rationale/scope | durable |

A re-pull starts the next review state and writes **distinct** frame + contract pages for it — never overwrite an earlier state's pages in place (the new frame reuses `subject_path` with the new `subject_oid`; the tree itself is updated in place).

Reference pages by name. Children `notebook_read` on demand; they do not preload bodies. The coordinator serializes writes with a process-local ordering so same-name writes don't race.

### State-bound artifact store

The run retains exact source captures and capture provenance, `claims-draft/3`, the units manifest and unit payloads, P0.4 per-box JSONL attempts, the merged `join-draft/1`, P0.5 check/assignment evidence and the run manifest. Record exact-byte sha256 refs; keep the shipped chunker path/hash/recipe bound to `cure_light_source_head_oid`. These identities make artifacts verifiable, not semantically canonical. P0.4 children write only their assigned box file; the coordinator owns notebook pages and the merge. Heavy join rows stay in the artifact store and are consumed by path, not pasted wholesale into the coordinator's context. Two stores are allowed, and either (or a documented mix) may be used:

- **paginated content-addressed notebook artifact pages** (the `claims-`/`coverage-` pages plus bounded `-p<k>`/artifact shards), or
- a **durable run-artifact store** mounted outside the subject (surviving sandbox teardown), with the notebook page carrying refs + hashes and the reassembly rule.

Whichever store holds the recorded bytes — notebook artifact pages or a durable run store — it is content-addressed and verifiable: run-store files used only as execution cache are not authoritative; notebook pages may hold the recorded bytes directly (paginated, content-addressed) under the same reassembly/hash-equality rule, and when the durable store holds the recorded artifact the notebook pages are projections of it. **No pretty-JSON substitute:** a re-rendered summary, a pretty-printed copy or a partial excerpt never replaces the recorded bytes, and a projection whose reassembled bytes/hash differ from the recorded artifact is invalid. **Lifecycle:** recorded artifacts and their projections are kept through the state's closure/finalization window and retired only after a durable snapshot with matching hash lands (claims/coverage pages per their table rows); a retirement never leaves a live state page referencing unreachable bytes. A new review state gets a new `-s<n>` set and never overwrites or reuses the previous state's artifacts.

A per-box artifact has one child writer and an exact assigned path; preserve failed attempts and require P0.5 checks before publishing a current merge. A child success message is not proof that the expected file exists. Missing or truncated rows never become zero-link candidates. This file-based output decision applies to P0.4; it does not relocate V1's authoritative coverage records out of the notebook.

### Coverage pages

`coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` is the summary/index for a state's Vector 1
changed-unit accounting; `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>-p<k>` are its ledger
shards, paged by surface/shard/claim group so a mega-diff ledger stays inside
a notebook page (50 KB / 2000 lines). The index carries the denominator,
counts, exclusion policy and completion flags plus exact shard refs, so
closure and finalization can cite the accounting without loading every shard.

## Content rules

- **Findings are recoverable facts** — keep the evidence-format rows; discard tender re-derivable code trivia freely at handoff.
- **The symbol map is a bounded state cache.** Structured artifact data (symbols, counts, capped locations) that survives the state's handoffs because V3 and the post-handoff yagni pass consume it — never raw search logs. A re-pull is a new state: a new `-s<n>` page, never an overwrite or silent reuse.
- **Coverage records are structured machine records, not findings.** Vector 1's changed-unit accounting (unit/range, accounting state, attribution edges, evidence refs — conformance-pass.md) lives in the `coverage-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` summary/index and its bounded `-p<k>` shards; these in-notebook pages are the authoritative store — never findings rows, raw logs, or scratch files. Workers read only their assigned pages/slices. A re-pull is a new state with its own `-s<n>` coverage pages, never an overwrite. The summary page carries the denominator + counts + completion flags + per-shard assignment refs/digests so closure/finalization can cite the accounting without the shards; coverage pages stay through the closure/finalization window and retire after durable snapshots land — a closure run never depends on a dead link.
- **V1 validates/freezes the claim universe.** `claims-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` references the retained Phase-0 draft and the source-bound V1 validation/freeze record. A draft summary or a child's local slice is never the complete queryable directory. Preserve source identity, claim interpretation and changes from the draft; the detailed freeze schema remains an operator checkpoint. Negative attribution without an adequately validated/queryable universe returns `UNRESOLVED`, never permission inferred from P0.5.
- **Sources enter the contract only by explicit designation.** In-diff spec/design material is a claim source only when the PR body, linked issue or a locked decision points at it; repo convention interprets a designated package (normative vs advisory, delta vs baseline), never authorizes one (intake-and-scope.md §0.2). Non-capturable pointed material is context with a stated limitation. Source/consistency/`review_basis` records are coordinator process records, not findings.
- **Contract repair is a new state, not an overwrite.** A changed PR body/issue or in-diff source — even with an unchanged subject OID when no code changed — writes a new `-s<n>` contract/claims set; prior states stay addressable at their own pins (closure-verification.md).
- **Decisions are non-recoverable** — always persist: operator deferrals, closed-by-operator records, locked decisions from the issue. Never let them go stale or vanish on compaction.
- **The contract page is verbatim, bounded.** The Phase-0 contract is the one long-form page: PR claims + locked decisions preserved byte-exact (intake-and-scope.md §0.2). Never paste raw diffs, logs, or kernel text into it.
- **No raw transcripts/logs.** A vector's dead ends and working notes do not belong in the notebook; the closure table's `re-opened` row records the reason concisely.
- **Research compliance is part of the record.** Per-split Vector-2/3 RESEARCH TRACE outcomes (compliance table) append to `pr-<n>-review` with the vector; shadow-split comparisons land there too when enabled.

## The seal-then-handoff step

When `handoff` is available and the operator confirms the frame:

1. Write `pipeline-frame-<owner>-<pr>-s<n>` (compiled options + planned subject mechanism — the manifest's tree fields land at the Phase 0 gate) and `pr-<n>-review` (findings skeleton).
2. Discard recoverable code-trivia pages; refresh the durable decision page.
3. Draft the handoff prompt that carries ONLY: the frame's location, the current state (intake complete, requirements pass/fallback), the immediate next step (Phase 0 pull subject + contract → Vector 1), and any blocker or failed path worth avoiding.
4. Call `handoff` with `discardPages` for code-trivia pages and the task prompt pointing at the frame page by name.

The next context reads the frame page, loads kernel references on demand, and kicks off Phase 0 → Vector 1 — it does not re-fetch the kernel.

## If no handoff

Continue in-session; the frame and findings pages still carry the state. The operator sees the compiled plan inline instead of via a fresh context.
