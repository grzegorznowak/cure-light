## Unreleased (working tree)

### v0.1.0 — initial pipeline

First pass of the cure-light PR review pipeline as a standalone repo, modeled on PhormOS:

**kernel/**
- Skeletons a three-vector review method (conformance / implementation / debt), a pinned-commit manifest, an intake/contract phase, and a closure re-review loop.
- Pass contracts define the per-vector fleet split, child prompt contract, evidence return format, origin classification, and disposition rules.
- Evidence format standardizes findings, severities, statuses (incl. `closed-by-operator` and `deferred-decision`).

**libs/pi-driver/**
- Requirements check for pi runtimes (gh auth, repo, PR OID, checkout-at-head, notebook, fleet groups, diff, optional chunkhound).
- Notebook plan contract: `pipeline-frame-<owner>-<pr>`, findings page, decisions page; coordinator-owns writes; seal-then-handoff.

**templates/assets/docs**
- KICKOFF.md intake template, finding-schema.json, child-pass-prompt-template, example-review (PR #27 worked run), OPEN-ISSUES.md.

Known limitations at v0.1:
- Auth-aware/null-cache derivation deferrals are documented in OPEN-ISSUES, not silently tolerated.
- Fleet group requirement is tolerant (inherit-parent fallback) but semantically changes the run; prefer single-pass without the plugin.
- Bootstrap manifest raw URLs resolve against `main`.

### Roadmap (draft)
- Force `checkout == head` as a hard preflight check (currently recommended, not enforced).
- Option/batch pipeline runs for low-traffic PRs.
- Auto-draft as explicit "strict gate" mode for trusted repos.
